Thie is a curent work in progress build for a nice little Neo-Tokyo type look for users on their Jellyfin server. Currently this is on build 10.11.6 and looks almost perfect (besides some color issues) on mobile. However there are a couple of glitches that are being worked on for the desktop site. Anyone that would like to use this can us it and even build upon it. This was made possible by using AI to assist (since I don't know much about coding CSS) so there are bound to be things that can be tightened up within the code the code to make it a bit better. As for now I'm unsure if importing the github URL will work to add the theme to your Jellyfin server, so I have been using the raw code itself.



Down below will have images of how this theme currently looks.

There are currently a couple issues with the desktop site which I'm aware of but cannot get it looking correct which I will show below. If there is anyone that would like to contribute in making this work a bit better for the desktop side, please let me know.

Known issue #1 (Screen after selecting a title) [Only on PC web side]
  -Title in cyan runs off the screen instead of wrapping correctly
  -Color of certain areas seem to be a purple color
  -Poster of the media seems to overlap over other areas

Known issue #2 (same as one small issue in #1)
  -Selection areas seem to be a purple color
