Thie is a curent work in progress build for a nice little Neo-Tokyo type look for users on their Jellyfin server. Currently this is on build 10.11.6 and looks almost perfect (besides some color issues) on mobile. However there are a couple of glitches that are being worked on for the desktop site. Anyone that would like to use this can us it and even build upon it. This was made possible by using AI to assist (since I don't know much about coding CSS) so there are bound to be things that can be tightened up within the code the code to make it a bit better. As for now I'm unsure if importing the github URL will work to add the theme to your Jellyfin server, so I have been using the raw code itself.
